- Parser
	- new syntax
	- bit vectors

- Type Checker
	- Improve error messages

- Pretty printer
- Interpreter
- Symbolic execution?

Notes:
- Where clauses of in-parameters: according to the manual can mention out-parameters, but actually can't
- Breaks with labels. a: b: while(...) {break a;} is not allowed in the implementation (as is l: break l;), but seems to be allowed by the manual.
- The syntax of WhereClause is missing in the boogie manual

Changed syntax:
- Multiple function argument declarations with a single type
- call * := Q(x, y);
- type T, U;
