- Overall
  - Unsupported syntax    
    - bit vectors    
    - reals, /, **, int(), real(), decimal/float litearls
    - call * := Q(x, y), call forall to a procedure with out-parameters
    - empty map domains x: []int    
    - code expression
  - Optimization: e.g. better data structures instead of lists  
  - Do not throw away attributes and triggers
  - Dynamic assertion (loop invariant) inference (testing + statistical test)?

- Type checker
  - Use semantic representation of types not just for comparison?
  - Data type for type errors (will be easier to evaluate test results)
  - Use lenses for Context?
  - Annotate AST with expr types
  
- Interpreter
  - Constraint extraction:    
    - Do not ignore forall constraints with non-simple arguments
    - Skolemize existentials
    - Infer constraints from axioms that mention a map update (using not-equals guard?)
    - Do not ignore forall constraints for constants
    - Check if we need to normalize expressions before extracting constraints    
    - Move definitions/constraints without guards to the front      
  - Indexing maps by maps
  - Execution
    - Change quantifier evaluation
      - Type variables?
    - Introduce logical variables
    - Get rid of FDef 
    - Integrate SMT constraint solving  
  - Mark executions in which a definitional axiom is violated as suspicious? (It is usually a sign of ill-defined recursive definition)?
  
  - Error reporting: when violated spec has logical vars, output their values
  - Evaluation of quantification over types: is it worth to do it with brute force?
  - Refactor executeLocally, execCall and execProcedure (and saveOld/restoreOld?)
  - Refactor evalVar, setAnyVar and so on, so that there is a unified meachism to lookup a name in the type context
  - Lazy initialization of arguments (in execLocally only copy those args that are already initialized, at the end propage the initizlization back with assume)
  - Extends ordering
  - Turn source positions into spans; use the end of the span to report postcondition violations  
    
- User interface
  - pass more information with failures other than spec violations, so that relevant variables can be determined
  - settings for disabling checking of different specs
  - interactive sessions
  - debugger: generated logs and traverse them?
